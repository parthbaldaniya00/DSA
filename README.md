# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Learning Repository**! 🚀  
This repository contains my implementations and notes on various DSA topics using **Java**.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here
- **Basic Data Structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, etc.)
- **Advanced Data Structures** (Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables, etc.)
- **Algorithms** (Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, etc.)
- **Problem-Solving** (Solutions to popular DSA problems)

## 🔧 Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (**JDK 8+**)
- A code editor like **VS Code**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, or **Eclipse**
